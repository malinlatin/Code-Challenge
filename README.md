Code-Challenge
==============

My code for a code challenge (description below)

The project is to create an App with a Carousel as follows:

Show 2 different views of the same 8 images as follows:
1. a horizontal view that shows 5 images at a time but one can swipe through the images in an infinite loop.  As in:
        - initially images 1-5 are visible in a horizontal strip.
        - swiping to the left shifts images left to show images 2-6, then 3-7, then 4-8, then 5-8 & 1, then 6-8 & 1-2, etc.
        - swiping to the right shifts images the opposite way.
        - make it so that the image in the center grows to be larger than the other 4.
        - make all images the same width
2. a circular view that shows all 8 images at once, but appears as if the images at the bottom of the circle are close than those at the top.

Donâ€™t wait until all data is downloaded to start showing data.

Also, add a button to shuffle the order of the images. Each time the button is clicked the order of images is changing to a new RANDOM order. Implement the shuffle as efficiently as you can.
